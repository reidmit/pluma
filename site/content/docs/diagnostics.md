When the compiler rejects a program it emits one or more **diagnostics**. Every
diagnostic the frontend produces (parse errors from the tokenizer/parser, and
analysis/type errors from the checker) carries a **stable code** so you, your
editor, and tooling can refer to it precisely.

## Anatomy of a diagnostic

```
error[E0100]: Name `lenght` is not defined.
  ╭─▸ src/main.pa:3:12
  │
3 │ def main = lenght
  │            ^^^^^^
  │
  ╰─ help: did you mean `length`?
```

The left margin is a single unbroken rail: it opens at the location (`╭─▸`), runs
down the source excerpt (`│`), and closes through the help/notes (`╰─`).

- **`error` / `warning`** — the severity. Warnings (e.g. an unused binding) don't
  stop compilation on their own.
- **`[E0100]`** — the stable code. It never changes meaning across releases, so
  it's safe to link to, filter on, or cite.
- **`╭─▸ file:line:col`** — the primary location (1-based).
- **The caret span** points at the offending source.
- **`help:`** — a single actionable suggestion. Misspelled names, fields, and
  enum variants get a `did you mean ...?` hint computed from what's actually in
  scope.
- **`note:`** — extra context (e.g. the fields a record actually has).

Some diagnostics carry a **secondary label** — a second pointed-at location. For
example, a duplicate definition points at both the redefinition and the original:

```
error[E0112]: Duplicate top-level definition `config`.
  ╭─▸ src/main.pa:3:5
  │
1 │ def config = 1
  │     ^^^^^^ previous definition here
  ┆
3 │ def config = 2
  │     ^^^^^^
  ╰─
```

(The dashed `┆` segment stands in for source lines skipped between the two spans.)

The language server surfaces all of this too: the code appears on the diagnostic,
help/notes are folded into the hover message, and secondary labels become related
information.

The authoritative source for these codes is the `code()` method on `ParseError`
and `AnalysisError` in the `compiler` crate; this table mirrors it. The
`tests/errors/` snapshot suite exercises one fixture per error path and pins the
exact rendered output, so the messages here stay honest.
