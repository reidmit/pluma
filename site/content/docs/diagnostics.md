When the compiler rejects a program it emits one or more **diagnostics**. Every
diagnostic the frontend produces (parse errors from the tokenizer/parser, and
analysis/type errors from the checker) carries a **stable code** so you, your
editor, and tooling can refer to it precisely.

## Anatomy of a diagnostic

```
error[E0100]: Name `lenght` is not defined.
  ╭─▸ src/main.pa:3:12
  │
3 │ def main = lenght
  │            ^^^^^^
  │
  ╰─ help: did you mean `length`?
```

The left margin is a single unbroken rail: it opens at the location (`╭─▸`), runs
down the source excerpt (`│`), and closes through the help/notes (`╰─`).

- **`error` / `warning`** — the severity. Warnings (e.g. an unused binding) don't
  stop compilation on their own.
- **`[E0100]`** — the stable code. It never changes meaning across releases, so
  it's safe to link to, filter on, or cite.
- **`╭─▸ file:line:col`** — the primary location (1-based).
- **The caret span** points at the offending source.
- **`help:`** — a single actionable suggestion. Misspelled names, fields, and
  enum variants get a `did you mean ...?` hint computed from what's actually in
  scope.
- **`note:`** — extra context (e.g. the fields a record actually has).

Some diagnostics carry a **secondary label** — a second pointed-at location. For
example, a duplicate definition points at both the redefinition and the original:

```
error[E0112]: Duplicate top-level definition `config`.
  ╭─▸ src/main.pa:3:5
  │
1 │ def config = 1
  │     ^^^^^^ previous definition here
  ┆
3 │ def config = 2
  │     ^^^^^^
  ╰─
```

(The dashed `┆` segment stands in for source lines skipped between the two spans.)

The language server surfaces all of this too: the code appears on the diagnostic,
help/notes are folded into the hover message, and secondary labels become related
information.

| E0117 | Ambiguous trait-method dispatch (unbound type variables) |
| E0118 | Overlapping instance |
| E0119 | Orphan instance |
| E0120 | Refutable pattern in a `let` |
| E0121 | Duplicate field in a record pattern |
| E0122 | `try` right-hand side has an undetermined type |
| E0123 | `try` on an unsupported carrier |
| E0124 | `try` with no continuation |
| E0125 | `try` with an unsupported left-hand pattern |
| E0126 | `??` left-hand side has an undetermined type |
| E0127 | `??` on an unsupported carrier |
| E0128 | `built-in` requires a type annotation |
| E0129 | `built-in` must be a top-level def's right-hand side |
| E0130 | Unknown regex character class |
| E0131 | `where`-clause type variable not in the signature |
| E0132 | Item is private to its module |
| E0133 | `remote def` (RPC endpoint) is not `public` |
| E0134 | `remote def` has an invalid endpoint signature |
| E0135 | Bare variant must be qualified by its enum |

The authoritative source for these codes is the `code()` method on `ParseError`
and `AnalysisError` in the `compiler` crate; this table mirrors it. The
`tests/errors/` snapshot suite exercises one fixture per error path and pins the
exact rendered output, so the messages here stay honest.

## Lints (`L0xxx`)

Lints are advisory warnings from `pluma lint`, a separate parse-based pass over
your source — they flag stylistic and correctness smells the type-checker
tolerates. `pluma lint <paths…>` reports them (and exits non-zero if any fire, so
it can gate CI); your editor surfaces them inline through the language server.
Lints never stop a `run`/`build`/`test`.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| L0001 | `let _ = expr` binds nothing — drop the `let _ =` |
| L0002 | `try _ = expr` binds nothing — write just `try expr` |
| L0003 | Comparing to a boolean literal (`x == true`) is redundant |
| L0004 | `if c { true } else { false }` is just the condition |
| L0005 | Boolean-literal operand of `&&`/`||` is redundant |
| L0006 | Function only forwards its arguments (`fun x { f x }` is `f`) |
| L0007 | Both branches of an `if` are identical |
| L0008 | A binding returned immediately doesn't need the `let` |

The `tests/lint/` snapshot suite pins one fixture per lint, the same way
`tests/errors/` does for compiler diagnostics.
